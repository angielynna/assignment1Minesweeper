# Assignment 1: Minesweeper Project

Team members: Amtoj Kaur, Angelynna Pyeatt, Leyla Ahmed

Time taken to produce solution:

Each member took between 5-9 hours to generate a working solution.
Coming together to produce an official solution, generator, and input text file took 2 hours
The entire JUnit testing process took about 3 hours. This includes prep, deciding which tests were necessary, 
learning more about JUnit testing, and creating the test cases.

Overall the project took between 10 - 14 hours.

Shortcomings/concerns with the solution:
    
- Runtime, currently we believe the runtime isn't as fast as it could be, we plan on maybe revisiting
in the future

- Cyclomatic complexity is pretty high and could result an excessive amount of test cases.
